Companies with R&D expenditures may outperform the market as they are thought to be on the forefront of innovation. Secondly, because R&D expenses may suppress reported earnings in the short term, companies with this expense may be undervalued. By examining both value-weighted and equally weighted portfolios, this analysis seeks to explore if alphas exist for portfolios constructed with companies that invest in research and development (R&D). Through this approach, the project will explore if investing in companies with this expenditure is a viable strategy for investors seeking superior performance to the return of the market.

Wharton WRDS was used to access the datasets necessary for this research. Annual fundamental data, including R&D expense and revenue per company was downloaded using Compustat. For returns data, CRSP monthly returns (version 2) was used with important variables including monthly price (MthPrc), monthly market capitalization (MthCap) and monthly returns (MthRet). Additionally, the Ken French data library was used to download monthly risk-free rates, as well as the market returns minus the risk free rate. For this analysis, we used January 1980 â€“ December 2022.
